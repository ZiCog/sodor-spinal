# sodor-spinal

An implementation of the Sodor 1-Stage RISC-V processor in SpinalHDL.

sodor-spinal is my attempt to:

    a) Learn some SpinalHDL
      http://spinalhdl.github.io/SpinalDoc/
  
    b) Get familiar with the RISC-V instruction set and instruction encoding.
    
To that end it is based on the Sodor 1-Stage RISC V design as described in the CSE 564 Computer Architecture course at Oakland    
https://passlab.github.io/CSE564/notes/lecture08_RISCV_Impl.pdf. This is all new code, not dervided from the Sodor Chesle implementation.

It is not expected that sodor-spinal ever be a useful RISC V core. There are already many better ones out there, in all shapes and sizes, written by people who know what they are doing! But it may one day be a useful example to learn something from. 

### Status

Incomplete. Just started. Not tested in any way.
